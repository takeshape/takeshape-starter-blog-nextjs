# Pattern

This folder contains a schema and sample content. You can add it to your TakeShape account by visiting https://app.takeshape.io/add-to-takeshape?repo=https://github.com/takeshape/takeshape-samples/tree/master/shape-blog-nextjs/pattern

This folder is not part of the client application. Once you have your schema set up in TakeShape, you can delete this folder.
